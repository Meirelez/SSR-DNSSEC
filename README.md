The DNS infrastructure used for this PoC was the one suggested on the SEED Labs, available at: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Networking/DNS/DNSSEC/, with some minor changes. 
The infrastructure, consists of a root server, a top-level domain server for edu, a domain server for example.edu, and a local DNS server.
